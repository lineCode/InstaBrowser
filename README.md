# InstaBrowser
InstaBrowser is a fork of [litebrowser](https://github.com/litehtml/litebrowser), which is translated to U++ conventions. Currently, the translation is not very perfect and performance is worse than in 
original, but it still can open some 
simplest 
html-pages correctly. Motivation for this work is purely curiosity towards the browser engine and the litehtml seemed to be a good start.
